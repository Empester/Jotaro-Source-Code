Jotaro is an open-source Discord bot.

Greetings and welcome to **Jotaro**, a full-featured, open-source Discord bot aimed at enriching the experience on your server with a vast selection of functions. With a focus on modularity, privacy, and community-focused feature progress, Jotaro is a stable partner for a multitude of applications ranging from moderation to fun interaction, utility commands, and custom automation.

## Introduction
The

Jotaro is built using the `discord.py` library, which utilizes modern Python asynchronous programming for flawless and scalable performance on multiple servers. It is carefully divided into plugins—specifically for each function—therefore making it easy to extend, customize, and maintain.

Essentially, Jotaro is natively supported with a SQLite database via the use of a specialized database manager to make persistent data storage efficient and safer. The architecture ensures fast retrieval, consistency, and easy deployment without imposing significant requirements for infrastructure.

## Architectural Framework and Core Elements

### Required Documents

- bot.py
The central bot class, extending `AutoShardedBot` to optimize multi-guild operations. Handles command prefix resolution, plugin loading, event hooks (ready, errors, completions), and integrates the database manager. It’s the foundation upon which all features are built and coordinated.

- db_manager.py
Handles communication with SQLite by encapsulating schema creation, queries, and updates. This style promotes data integrity and separates database logic from command implementations, thus enhancing maintainability and reliability.

# main.py
Entrypoint that initializes and launches the bot instance. Keeps startup procedures clean and focused.

- utilities.py
Helper functions utilized across plugins for common tasks, promoting code reuse and clarity.

- Data.py
It involves static configurations or mappings that many plugins reference, helping to provide uniformity.

- **schema.sql**
The database schema is modeled to organize persistent storage, with thoughtful design intended to include features like prefixes, user stats, reminders, and other functionalities.

- **waifu_list_final.json**
A large dataset powers the "waifu" themed plugin, enabling engaging user experiences through carefully crafted content.

- **anime.py** — Adds anime-themed commands, connecting the bot to popular fandom interactions.
The **audio.py** file handles music and voice channel operations, thus enabling voice interactions.
- **auto.py** — Automates repetitive tasks related to server administration.
- **bookmark.py** — Allows users to bookmark messages or content to refer to later.
- **botto.py** — This contains meta commands for bot details and statistics.
The **economy.py** module provides in-server economy functionality that includes virtual currency and transaction support.
- **fun.py** — A collection of fun commands to keep the community active.
- **goblet.py** — A plugin intended for themed games or competitions.
- **help.py** — Custom help command presenting command information neatly.
- **holy.py** — Holds commands that involve religious themes or playful connotations.
- **interactions.py** — Handles buttons, dropdowns, and other interactive components for Discord.
- **leveling.py** — It tracks user behavior for leveling and reward purposes.
- **meta.py** — Meta commands for managing plugins and bot internals.
- **misc.py** — Miscellaneous commands that don't fit into other modules.
- **mod.py** — Core moderator commands like kick, ban, mute, etc.
- **news.py** — Allows the sharing of news or announcements across servers.
-prefix.py — Supports server-specific prefix configuration.
- **purge.py** — Bulk message deletion command for moderation.
- **quiz.py** — Interactive quiz games for fun and entertainment.
- **reminder.py** — User reminders and timed notifications.
- **snipe.py** — Recalls recently deleted or edited messages.
- **tags.py** — Server-specific quick info snippets with custom tags.
- **ungrouped.py** — This file holds commands which are still under development or don't fit into a category yet.
- **vccontrol.py** — Commands for control and management of voice channels.
- **waifu.py** — This script enables waifu-themed interactions based on a JSON dataset.

## Privacy and Compliance

Jotaro is committed to respecting user privacy and operates in full accordance with EU GDPR and related regulations. Key privacy-conscious design decisions include:

- **Limited data storage:** We only store information that is necessary for the operation of the bot, such as server configurations, user levels, and usage statistics for commands. We do not store any personal information beyond what users volunteer.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Persistent data is stored locally in SQLite databases, thus eliminating the need for external data sharing.
- **Transparency:** The bot's commands and interactions neither expose sensitive information to the public nor third parties.
- **Ability for user control:** Users can control their own data, with features to reset levels or remove reminders.
- **Compliance-ready:** The practices and code comply with best-practice standards with respect to data protection and user consent.

This privacy basis allows for the owners and users to implement Jotaro with confidence, knowing that members' data rights won't be breached.

## Why Open Source?

Open sourcing Jotaro invites collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. Benefits include:

- **Community-driven enhancements**: Anyone can contribute features, bug fixes, or optimizations.

- **Transparency**: The users can inspect the code to ensure security and privacy guarantees.

Customization: Servers can customize the bot in line with their own requirements through editing or by using plug-ins.

Prospective developers can study a mature, large-scale bot architecture as a learning resource.

- **Sustainability**: Open collaboration ensures long-term project maintenance beyond individual developers.

Jotaro exemplifies how open-source software can empower communities through shared ownership and collective expertise.

## Getting Started First, clone the repository. One should create a Discord bot application and then get the bot token. 3. Configure `.env` with your token, owner ID, and desired description. 4. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. To start the bot, run the command `main.py`. Configure your own server prefixes and load or unload plugins as required. For a thorough listing of configuration parameters and commands, please refer to the related plugin documentation in the codebase. --- I am grateful you're interested in Jotaro. If you're a developer, administrator, or just an enthusiast, this project invites you to take part.
